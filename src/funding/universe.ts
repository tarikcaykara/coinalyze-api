/**
 * The stablecoin-margined venues coinalyze.net lists in the "Current / Predicted" table of every coin's
 * funding-rate page (BTC, ETH and SOL list the same ten; checked 2026-10-14). Labels match the page so
 * `bun run calibrate` can detect listing changes.
 *
 * A venue resolves to the one perpetual on `exchange` with `quote` for the coin (Coinalyze exchange codes).
 * `ratePeriodHours` is the period the API's predicted rate refers to; measured by calibration.
